<p>

 Gramma and Ginga are two sisters who live in Clarksburg, West Virginia.  Gramma is 104 years old and Ginga is 99.  A few years ago, my mother and uncle started to film them arguing with eachother and posting the videos on YouTube and FaceBook.  Instantly, the videos started to get millions and millions of views.  In the last 3 years, they have been on Jimmy Kimmel, Steve Harvey and many more famous websites.   </p>

  <h2> How It Started </h2>



   My Grandma would be the one to go to West Virginia and check-in on both Gramma and Ginga.  She would stay for a week at a time and come back to Virginia where she lived.  Sadly, when my grandmothe passed away in November of 2014, my mom and uncle took it upon themselves to not let Gramma and Ginga feel like no one would come see them.  After multiple visits to West Virginia to see the girls, my mom and uncle decided to start recording them argue and fight with each other.  They posted the videos on FaceBook and YouTube and it was instantly a hit.  They have hundreds of videos with over a million views on their page.  They also have millions of views on other websites such as: DailyMail and other famous FaceBook and YouTube profiles.  This brought my mom and uncle to start a FaceBook and YouTube page for Gramma and Ginga.
