<h2> NOT 21? </h2>
<div id="hh2">
<p> The Miami Herald 2009 Reader's Choice Awards rated Mansion, LIV at Fontainebleau and SET Nightclub as "the best dance spots." Mansion and LIV were also rated as having the best VIP areas. LIV is natoriously known as the hot spot for celebrities. Mokai Lounge was the best late-night bar/club on Miami Beach. Sunset Lounge offers the best lounges. A lot of people and students at Miami like to try to use fake ID's to get into these clubs.  They do not realize that the bouncers at these clubs are well-known and are super serious about the age verification.  If they are shown a fake ID, they can either take the ID from the individual and kick them out, or take the ID and the individual to the police to have them ticketed and kicked out. </p>
