  <b> Early Life </b>
  <ul>
    <p> Gramma, also known as Genevieve Musci, was born on March 21st, 1914.  When she was only 8 years old, she was hit and dragged 500 yards by a limo and was in critical condition.  The doctors told her father that she would likely die from the injuries sustained.  Her father, my great, great grandfather was a meat lover.  He prayed to God and said that he would give up eating meat until she was okay.  Fast forward a few years and Gramma was 100% okay and recovered.  When she was 16 years old, she moved away with her boyfriend and got married.  She had 2 kids a few years later.

<h2> Health </h2>
<div id="hh2">
<p> Everybody who knows gramma personally and those who just know about her through the videos always ask how her health is.  As of now, she is 100% healthy.  She lives on her own, cleans her house herself and is adamant on not having people try to make it any other way.  She has had a few falls here and there but she is still extremely strong and healthy.  For her birthday that was just last month, she was given hundreds of birthday cards throughout all over the world; the Philipines, India, China, Italy, Germany, Thailand and more.  It makes her happy to know that she is making others laugh.   </p>
